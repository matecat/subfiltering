 * This handler is a crucial part of the reverse transformation process. During sub-filtering,
 * literal '<' and '>' characters are often converted into safe placeholders (e.g., '##LESSTHAN##'
 * and '##GREATERTHAN##') to prevent them from being misinterpreted as XML/HTML tags.
 *
 * This class reverses that process, ensuring that the final output string has the correct
 * angle bracket characters, making it suitable for rendering or final storage where
